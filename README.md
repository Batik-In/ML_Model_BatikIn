# ML_Model_BatikIn
Machine Learning Model for BatikIn

The Steps for building BatikIN machine learning model :
1. Transform  dataset 
2. Decided 10 Batik classes to be trained, each of classes contain 250 picture in jpg. format. In total 2501 dataset
3. Split the dataset into training,test,and validation dataset
4. Implement Image augmentation for dataset 
5. Building CNN models with TensorFlow
6. Using XceptionTransfer Learning model 
7. Create top layers to identify 10 classes
8. Train and validate  the model
9. Testing the machine learning model using new images differ from training dataset

Here is Flowchart to explain process on Our Machine Learning Model
